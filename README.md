## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't necessarily learn something new in this project, but it undoubtedly helped to solidifying my knowledge about flexbox as I did struggle with part of the design.

### Continued development

I'm not entirely comfortable using flexbox still and I will need to continue working on it. I have yet to include grid into my own code and look forward to include it in my projects going forward.
